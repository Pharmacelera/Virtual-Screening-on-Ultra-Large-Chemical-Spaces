# Virtual-Screening-on-Ultra-Large-Chemical-Spaces
Data sets employed in the work titled: Synthon-Based Strategies Exploiting Molecular Similarity and Protein-Ligand Interactions for Efficient Screening of Ultra-Large Chemical Libraries 

Data:
validate_synthons_alignment/XTALS.sdf.gz -> Crystallographic structures of the molecules used to validate synthons alignment (80 molecules).
HITS_VS.tar.gz -> folder with all the hits by target (.sdf and .smi format). Stereoisomers are included. 
Proteins_minimized.tar.gz -> minimized proteins used in this work to run structure-based simulations. 
KNIME_Clustering_Actives.knwf -> KNMIE workflow to cluster active molecules used in this work.
